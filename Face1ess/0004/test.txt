This is the best of times, it was the worst of times;
This is the best of times, it was the worst of times;
This is the wisdom of the times, it was foolish of times;
This is the era of trust, but also the age of suspicion;
This is the season of Light, but also the season of darkness;
This is the spring of hope, but also the winter of despair;
Our promising, while little reason for hope;
We are together toward heaven, we all go in another direction
